Unsupervised Sentiment Analysis using bert-base-multilingual-uncased-sentiment, to help me decide which basketball shoe I should buy next out of the specified options.

## Process:
### Data Collection:
I decided to turn to Reddit to collect post text and comments, as these tend to be very raw and unfiltered. There is a popular subreddit called BBallShoes which I thought would be perfect to scrape. I found many "report card/performance review" posts, many from one user with the same format which helped with consistency. I tried my best to use posts which seemed neutral or gave a review and opened more discussion, in order to open the possibility for an equal number of positive and negative sentiment reviews.

I had to add a time sleep while scraping to adhere to Reddit's scraping policy :/, that was annoying.
